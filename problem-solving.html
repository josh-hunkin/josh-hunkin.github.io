    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <br></br>

    <h2>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h2>

    <p>
        When I was a kid I used to play a lot of tennis. To master a forehand, backhand, serve etc, you have to have the right arm/body motion and the right grip. I found it very hard to master the backhand as a kid, a basic backhand. To solve this problem I stayed on the court for a while longer with my Dad just hitting the ball back and forth with him. He would video tape my shot and disect what I was doing right and wrong. We would review the video, I would fix my grip and then we would continue hitting. This reptitive practice is called continuous training (steady state training). I would perform this at a low to moderate intensity and it would drastically improve my game. I felt amazing after the practice because it is very fulfilling learning something new, especially after putting lots of work into whatever it is you're learning. It also does go to show that practice makes perfect.
    </p>

    <h2>How confident do I feel using the following problem solving techniques</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Psuedocode</li>
        <li>Trying something</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky dethod</li>
        <li>Reading error messages</li>
        <li>Console.logging</li>
        <li>Googling</li>
        <li>Asking my peers for help</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>
        I feel confident with most of them. I wouldn't say I am too confident with the Rubber ducky method, console.logging and asking coaches for help. Aside from those, I am very confident with asking peers for help. I know I can reach out whenever and vice versa. I am also very confident with knowing what to google, not so confident on choosing the best solution. My most turned to resources has to be YouTube and MDN. I also often turn to peers who have completed the task for tips.
