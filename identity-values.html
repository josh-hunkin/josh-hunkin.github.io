<h1>My Personal Identity</h1>

    <h2 class="spacefromtop">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:</h2>
        
        <p>There was an incident at school where one of my really good friends went through something horrible. She had to take it up the ranks of the school, even having
            police involved. The decision I had to make was who to side with. I undoubtedly sided with her, for two reasons. One being the accusation was terrible, two being
            she was one of my best friends. I couldn't bear to see her alone in this. The unfortunate side of this was having a group of boys at the school take a disliking to 
            me. Because of this they gave me grief whenever they could. In the end it was still 100% worth taking her side. It was the right thing to do.
        </p>

        <br></br>
            
            <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:

            </h2>
            
            <p>Living in New Zealand my culture has mainly come from living in this beautiful country, but as well as coming from my mum who was born in Chile and moved here 
                halfway through her life. I have gained a sense of community from NZ, a kicked back personality and a solid attitude toward performing in areas I enjoy most. 
                From my mum I have gained a sense of family first, determination in all areas, and the importance of just being yourself no matter what. Both cultures have
                shaped me into who I am today.</p>

                <br></br>
                
                <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3> Strengths:</h3>
                
                <p> A few strengths I have recognised thanks to my feedback and personal experience would be I am honest, compassionate, loyal, determined, reliable and when it
                    comes to it, a team player.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Limitations:</h3>
                    
                    <p>My innocence that will become learndness with age, my current routine, my sensitivity when I really get to know someone.</p>

                    <br></br>

                    <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:</h2>

                    <p>I think my determination, as well as my honesty will really help me. I think my determination will help me because I won't stop at anything until the task at
                        hand is done and dusted. As well with my honesty, it will help me create solid, sustainable work and personal relationships in the future. With these traits,
                        networking will become a bit easier, reliability from colleagues will be stronger, team playing will be easier. </p>

                        <br></br>

                        <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
                            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why:</h2>

                            <p>In class at my previous school, there would be times where the class was paired with someone they didn't really know to work together. Sometimes I found it 
                                difficult to work with my peer as we didn't know eachothers strengths, limitations, mindset etc. At the time my strategy would have been to just observe 
                                my peers interest in the topic at hand and finish the task based on that. It worked okay but it wasn't amazing. Sometimes someone would do less, sometimes
                                more. There was no plan so therefore it usually wasn't as smooth as I was hoping. </p>

                                <br>

                                <p>A strategy I would try now would be: Get to know my peer a bit, observe their way of thinking and discuss a plan to tackle the task at hand. I will discuss 
                                    our strengths and weaknesses in the topic, and have a go at segments based on that. I would try this because it allows us not only to analyze the task and
                                    structure how we will approach it, but also understand where we are confident, and where we struggle so if it comes to it we can knowingly assist eachother.</p>
