    <h1>The DOM</h1>
    <p>From what I currently understand, the 'DOM' stands for 'Document Object Model'. The DOM is basically the tree of a web page, from the grandparents, all the way down to the children. This allows you to access specific elements of a web page with java script or browser web dev tools. You might use it to test your website scaling & functionality, or maybe to play around with the source code without consequence.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h1>The relationship between HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>Html is like the lyricist and producer of a song. The lyricist adds the structure and basic output that holds everything together nicely giving Css more than enough to work with. Css is the mixing and mastering engineer of the studio. Css will fine tune the website make the website presentable.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
    <h2>If I were to explain control flow using an analogy, I would have to say this:</h2>
    <p>Control flows are like cooking your own food versus going to a restaurant. When going to a restaurant, you're paying a lot of money for one dinner, but you're assured the food will taste great. When you cook your own food, you're paying very little money, but you still have to know how to cook it right.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>If I were to explain loops using an analogy, I would have to say this:</h2>
    <p>Loops are like woking out. If you work out too little, you won't really build muscle. If you unknowingly work out too hard, you coould potentially tear a muscle or worse. But if you get it just right, you build bigger muscle faster than you could of thought possible. You just have to put the perfect amount into it.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h1>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>
    <p>Accessing data from an array is good for when you want to store lots of singlular data and access a specific value. An object can also store lots of data but the data itself means more. It is data that can be associated with another pair of data, like a 'car' that is 'blue'.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h2>
    <p>A function is code that creates, well, a function. But a function can only work if it is called with [function-name]() What a function actually does is initiate a variable/variables and return whatever you set it to return.</p>
