    <h1>MY PLAN</h1>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Where I am now:</h2>
    
    <p>I can create a basic website with html and css. I can create basic hover effects and shapes with css, as well as basic nav bars.</p>
    
    <br></br>

    <h2>What I want to achieve by the end of foundations:</h2>

    <p>At the end of foundations I expect myself to know how to create basic animations, basic transition effects, and basic back end development. </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>How I will achieve this:</h2>

    <p>I will use resources I find very helpful such as freecodecamp.org, w3schools.com and YouTube. I will do this alongside my Dev Academy Foundations Handbook.
      I will track my time with Toggl, I will do this because it is satisfying to see something done within a reasonable time, not overdoing it or underdoing it. 
      I will take breathers to sit back and assess how I will tackle the task if I am finding it challenging because the last thing you want to do is pointlessly
      destroy your energy reserves just to have nothing done. 
      I will take a single 2 hour break a day, leaving the rest of the day to deep, uninterrupted focus on my tasks.
      I will plan my day accordingly the night before so when I get up I can grab my coffee and get stuck into the day.
      </p>

      <br></br>

      <h2>My long/term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>

      <p>I will love to pursue a career in game/app development. I will also enjoy some ecommerce projects on the side.</p>

      <br></br>

      <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h2>

      <br>
      
      <h3>STRENGTHS:</h3>

      <p>My strengths would be applying utmost detail to my work, but this can also be a limitation. Another strength I have is emotional intelligence.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>LIMITATIONS:</h3>

      <p>My current limitation would be my focus for hours on end, but over time this muscle/habit is strengthening as I get back into the routine. I can see myself being
        fully capable of deep work by the end of foundations.</p>

        <br></br>

        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include -
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h2>

          <p>I will manage my time with personal schedules/deadlines to ensure I finish my workload on time. This will allow smooth output from the whole team during bootcamp 
            as no one will always be counting on me to finish. I will rely on myself and myself only to get my tasks done. I will train my ability to throw myself into deep
            work/focus. I have invested in noise cancelling headphones so I can remain working undistracted/uninteruptted.</p>

            <br></br>

            <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h2>

            <p>I will take a breather, write up a plan and assess what I am struggling with, and tackle problems one at a time. Taking a breather is important, I learned that
              when I started my blog and screwed up the css beyond repair. I just took a breather and that assisted me in taking the rational route as I could think clearly.
              </p>

              <br></br>

              <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h2>

              <p>I will seek help from my cohort and facilitator, as well as google. I have found w3schools to be very helpful. I will do this in a timely matter by seeking help
                before deadlines and making sure my cohort is available to assist and not overloaded with work themselves.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h2>

                <p>
                  I don't expect much other than support and positivity to help keep the journey smooth and enjoyable. From what I know our facilitators have already exceeded my
                  expectations.
