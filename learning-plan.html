    <h1>MY PLAN</h1>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Where I am now:</h2>
    
    <p>
      I can create a basic website with html and css. I can create basic hover effects and shapes with css, as well as basic nav bars.
    </p>
    
    <br></br>

    <h2>What I want to achieve by the end of foundations:</h2>

    <p>
      At the end of foundations I expect myself to know how to create basic animations, basic transition effects, and basic back end development. 
    </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>How I will achieve this:</h2>

    <p>
      I will use resources I find very helpful such as freecodecamp.org, w3schools.com and YouTube. I will do this alongside my Dev Academy Foundations Handbook.
      I will track my time with Toggl, I will do this because it is satisfying to see something done within a reasonable time, not overdoing it or underdoing it. 
      I will take breathers to sit back and assess how I will tackle the task if I am finding it challenging because the last thing you want to do is pointlessly
      destroy your energy reserves just to have nothing done. 
      I will take a single 2 hour break a day, leaving the rest of the day to deep, uninterrupted focus on my tasks.
      I will plan my day accordingly the night before so when I get up I can grab my coffee and get stuck into the day.
      </p>

      <br></br>

      <h2>My long/term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>

      <p>
        I will love to pursue a career in game/app development. I will also enjoy some ecommerce projects on the side. I will find companies that are known in the game development scene and secure roles, even if they are small, to gain experience in game development.
      </p>

      <br></br>

      <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h2>

      <br>
      
      <h3>STRENGTHS:</h3>

      <p>
        My strengths would be applying utmost detail to my work, but this can also be a limitation. Another strength I have is emotional intelligence.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3>LIMITATIONS:</h3>

      <p>
        My current limitation would be my focus for hours on end, but over time this muscle/habit is strengthening as I get back into the routine. I can see myself being
        fully capable of deep work by the end of foundations.
      </p>

        <br></br>

        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include -
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h2>

          <p>
            I will manage my time with personal schedules/deadlines to ensure I finish my workload on time. This will allow smooth output from the whole team during bootcamp 
            as no one will always be counting on me to finish. I will rely on myself and myself only to get my tasks done. I will train my ability to throw myself into deep
            work/focus. I have invested in noise cancelling headphones so I can remain working undistracted/uninteruptted.
          </p>

            <br></br>

            <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h2>

            <p>
              I will take a breather, write up a plan and assess what I am struggling with, and tackle problems one at a time. Taking a breather is important, I learned that
              when I started my blog and screwed up the css beyond repair. I just took a breather and that assisted me in taking the rational route as I could think clearly.
            </p>

              <br></br>

              <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h2>

              <p>
                I will seek help from my cohort and facilitator, as well as google. I have found w3schools to be very helpful. I will do this in a timely matter by seeking help
                before deadlines and making sure my cohort is available to assist and not overloaded with work themselves.
              </p>

                <br></br>

                <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h2>

                <p>
                  I don't expect much other than support and positivity to help keep the journey smooth and enjoyable. From what I know our facilitators have already exceeded my
                  expectations.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <h1>BOOTCAMP PLAN</h1>
                
                <br></br>

                <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to bootcamp:</h2>

        <br>
        
        <h3>STRENGTHS:</h3>
  
        <p>
          I think my strengths will be my conistent hours put into learning and my prolonged periods of intense focus when I am fully engaged. I find myself not wanting to stop when something really grabs my attention and interest. I am also decent at html and css.
        </p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>LIMITATIONS:</h3>
  
        <p>
          My current limitation would be Javascript. I am finding Javascript very difficult to understand as a whole, especially how to use it. Over time I am sure I will turn my limitation into a strength but for now I am worried I won't keep up with everyone.
        </p>
  
          <br></br>

                <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          
                <p>
                  I think my biggest challenge will be working with peers. I have been socialising very little in the past few months and I have lost touch. It's not to say social skills can't be developed but it has been a bit since I have had proper interaction with mates etc. I remember it being much easier haha
                </p>
          
                  <br></br>

                  <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
          
                  <p>
                    I would like to see my work with peers improve. I never really struggled with working in a pair/ with peers, but like I mentioned before it's been a while since I have met new people or interacted with new people. I think it's a very important skill to have and I am really looking forward to meeting like minded peers and learning with them.
                  </p>
            
                    <br></br>

                    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          
                    <p>
                      My only expectation is that we are provided with help if we are stuck. If I don't fully understand something and I can't find a solution, I expect help from the team to ensure I have a better understanding moving forward.
                    </p>
              
                      <br></br>

                      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          
                      <p>
                        I expect myself to put in the work whenever I can. This means I don't stop until I get it done. I expect myself to be resilient and to push through no matter how much I struggle. Mostly, I expect myself to just do my best no matter the circumstances. 
                      </p>
                
                        <br></br>
