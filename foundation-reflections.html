    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <br></br>

    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
      I learned that my brain/habits are malleable. I changed my habits through intensive work and over time adjusted to the intensity needed to complete foundations. I changed my mindset in such a way that whatever the challenge was, I would put in my all and wouldn't give up. I learned how to communicate with peers in a manner that took my EQ sky high. I still have much more to learn but I can safely say I am a lot more confident in reading emotion and behaviour. This is beneficial to the functionality of a team, even better for the foundation of a relationship. I also learned that you have to put in the work. You don't get a free lunch. You have to push yourself to your limits, that's how you succeed. Sure work smarter and not harder, but you don't learn to code over night.
    </p>

    <br></br>
   
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p>
      I see self awareness playing a major part in programming. I see it impacting your daily habits, your learning habits, and your approach to learning. Being aware of yourself (emotions, day to day experiences, the way you treat yourself), helps keep you in control. This means you won't only be good to yourself, but others as well. This is where empathy comes in. To be empathetic you have others emotions in mind. You are aware of how other people think and feel and you are open to their views/opinions. It obviously doesn't mean you should agree, but to have an open mind and to value anothers stance. This is very good to have in a team space where you are collaborating with other programmers. To keep in mind how others are feeling, you are creating a positive environment for everyone around you. This will boost self esteem and confidence when it comes to projects. 
  </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
      What personally surprised me about core learning is how quickly I picked up the neccessary skills to communicate in a team. I have never really worked in a team like I was introduced to during this time. Core learning opened me up to the idea of proper, intentional collaboration. At high school I wasn't ever introduced to such workflow. Core learning also taught me how important looking after myself is, not only for myself, but for my peers. 
    </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
      I would say the hardest part of it all was just meeting new people after withdrawing from a heavily social environment. I hadn't immeresed myself in such an environment for months and felt this course would re introduce me in a way in which it would not only train me, but almost ingrain it in my mind. It is something that takes practice and I see myself growing from the experience. I found the listening and looping exercise challenging, but the more I did it and the more I talked to peers, I became a bit more confident.
    </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

    <p>
      One reason that came to my mind instantly is the love yourself before you love others. I do see personal reflection and just personal love playing a bit role in the emotion you output. If you don't treat yourself with respect, I don't see how you can maintain treating others with respect. In a workplace you want to treat everyone well because not only will you be seeing them everyday, but treating your colleagues with respect will impact them positively as well. It will have them want to come back to work, it will build relationships, it will make it much easier to earn others respect. 
    </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

    <p>
      The last thing it feels like is a waste of time. If I didn't focus on my emotions, my habits, my energy, I wouldn't have succeeded in the tech aspect at all. I do think both topics are meaningful and should be balanced. I agree 110% with what Dev Academy is offering and who it will shape you to be in the future.
