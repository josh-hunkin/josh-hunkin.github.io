    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <br></br>

    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
      I learned that my brain/habits are malleable. I changed my habits through intensive work and over time adjusted to the intensity needed to complete foundations. I changed my mindset in such a way that whatever the challenge was, I would put in my all and wouldn't give up. I learned how to communicate with peers in a manner that took my EQ sky high. I still have much more to learn but I can safely say I am a lot more confident in reading emotion and behaviour. This is beneficial to the functionality of a team, even better for the foundation of a relationship. I also learned that you have to put in the work. You don't get a free lunch. You have to push yourself to your limits, that's how you succeed. Sure work smarter and not harder, but you don't learn to code over night.
    </p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p>
      I see self awareness playing a major part in programming. I see it impacting your daily habits, your learning habits, and your approach to learning. Being aware of yourself (emotions, day to day experiences, the way you treat yourself), helps keep you in control. This means you won't only be good to yourself, but others as well. This is where empathy comes in. To be empathetic you have others emotions in mind. You are aware of how other people think and feel and you are open to their views/opinions. It obviously doesn't mean you should agree, but to have an open mind and to value anothers stance. This is very good to have in a team space where you are collaborating with other programmers. To keep in mind how others are feeling, you are creating a positive environment for everyone around you. This will boost self esteem and confidence when it comes to projects.
